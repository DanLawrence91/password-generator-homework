# password-generator-homework

## Description
- The aim of this code is to generate a random password after the user goes through a series of prompts

- There will be validations in place so that certain criteria are met, this includes the password being no less than 8 and no more than 128, if a number outside this range is selected the user will get an alert to start again. The other validation will make sure at least one of the following criteria are selected: lowercase characters, uppercase characters, special characters and numbers.

- The user will be taken through a series of prompts and confirms to select the criteria their password will be made up of. Once they have made a selection for all the generator will create a password of the given the character length they selected on the first prompt, this will be made up of the character sets they have selected through the confirm messages.
